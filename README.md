The Age Detection System using OpenCV is a computer vision-based solution that uses artificial intelligence to estimate the age group of a person by analyzing their facial features. In recent years, age estimation has gained traction in multiple domains including security, retail analytics, entertainment, and smart human-computer interaction. This project uses OpenCVâ€™s deep learning module (dnn) and a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to deliver accurate age classification in real-time or from images.
